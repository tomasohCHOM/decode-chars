# Decode Characters Interview Question

The question asks to decode an encoded string by the following conditions:

- A given character is followed by an integer value, which represents its count or frequency in that portion of the decoded string.
- The decoded string must follow the sequential order of the encoded string.

For example, the input encoded string `"B1c2d4a2"` must be decoded to `"Bccddddaa"`. Likewise, the input string `"a10c3"` would be decoded to `"aaaaaaaaaaccc"`.

This repository represents my solution of this problem written in C++!

## Running

Compile the C++ file and then run the program on your terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main.o
./main.o
```
